# js_idlegame_prototyping
Many versions of an web based idle game I'm prototyping.
  
To run any of them after downloading you will need node. Open a terminal session in the folder containing server.js, (or just cd until you are in there), and run ```node server.js```.   
  
  The server will then be hosting the game at ```localhost:3000```.
